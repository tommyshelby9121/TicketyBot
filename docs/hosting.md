# ☁️ Hosting Tickety

We will be going over on how to host Tickety by yourself on a VPS (Virtual Private Server). For all that is unholy, please don't use Heroku, Glitch nor repl.it for hosting.

## Prerequisites

> Note: I will not be going over the basics such as creating a server, logging in via ssh and other basics. Feel free to research that on your own time!

1. Familiarize yourself with Linux since this tutorial will be for Ubuntu 20.4

2. Choose a good hosting provider. You can look up some for yourself, but I will be recommding Digital Ocean for this. You can use my referral code [here](https://m.do.co/c/0ca904582444) to earn $100 for free for 60 days

    - The $5/mo plan would be plenty for Tickety
    
3. Have SSH setup on the VPS for maximum security and don't use root user.

    - Please check out [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04) if you're unsure how to create new users
    - Also make sure you have proper firewalls setup
